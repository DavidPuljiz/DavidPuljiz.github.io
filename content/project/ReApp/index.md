The central aim of the ReApp project was to make robot systems economically viable even for low-volume production. This was made possible through the use of new software components that offer companies more flexible and reusable solutions. [Project description](https://ipr.iar.kit.edu/english/315_1863.php)

The main topics of the project were:
- Semantic description of the capabilities and interaction schemes of the hardware components (e.g. robot, conveyor belt, etc.) with standardised interfaces and ‘plug & produce’ function.

- Semantic description of the software components with standardised interfaces and program modules provided with quality metrics (e.g. path planning, object recognition, etc.)

- Specification of a semantic capability description language for comparing the available capabilities of the robot system with the requirements of the programming modules (‘skill matching’).

- Development of an intuitive development environment and an intelligent programming assistant for robot applications: Linking the programming modules to robot applications and exporting executable programmes

- Provision of an integration platform for system integration: installation, configuration of components and execution of applications on the robot system.

- Development of a cloud-based simulation environment for the systematic execution of component, integration and application tests before commissioning the real robot cells.

As part of the ReApp project my main work focused on implementing ROS drivers for the SICK PIM60 camera system as well as co-develop the soldering pad detection system. Both were used, together with reusable components developed from other partners, to implement a live demonstration of autonomous soldering presented at the Hannover Messe 2016 [News Article](https://ipr.iar.kit.edu/english/2427.php).
