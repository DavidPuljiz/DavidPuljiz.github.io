The central aim of the ReApp project was to make robot systems economically viable even for low-volume production. This was made possible through the use of new software components that offer companies more flexible and reusable solutions. [Project description](https://ipr.iar.kit.edu/english/315_1863.php)

As part of the ReApp project my main work focused on implementing ROS drivers for the SICK PIM60 camera system as well as co-develop the soldering pad detection system. Both were used, together with reusable components developed from other partners, to implement a live demonstration of autonomous soldering presented at the Hannover Messe 2016 [News Article](https://ipr.iar.kit.edu/english/2427.php).
