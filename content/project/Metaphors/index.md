As part of the paper "Collection of Metaphors for Human-Robot Interaction" I have designed and drawn several art pieces. The goal was to envision novel ways of thinking about and approaching the design of robots themselves. Can a robot be disobedient ? How can robots form a choir ? How can a robot as a bridge be a metaphor for robotics connecting people ? 

It was a very interesting and different approach to robotics, and I had a lot of fun drawing strange robots doing stranger things.

From left to right: Huligan robot drawing graffiti; A swarm of robots using paint for communication with each other, like ants. A soft robot filled with paint. A robot leaving painted footprints, maybe as a localisation aid...")
