## Description

HoloRobot is the collection of software me and my students developed over the years as part of my research on Human-robot Interaction through the use of Head-mounted Displays and Wearables. A large part of this research was published as part of my PhD dissertation: "Adapting the Human: Human-robot Interaction mediated by Wearable Technology and Augmented Reality"

## Code

The code is split in two repositories.

The Unity repository contains different unity projects to be compiled and deployed directly onto the Microsoft HoloLens.

The ROS repository contains many projects written to function in ROS, the Robot Opperating System - an open source robbotic middleware suite.
