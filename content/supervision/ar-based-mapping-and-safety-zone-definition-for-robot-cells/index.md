abstract: Classical approaches of building a model of a robot cell are often time-consuming, costly and require expert knowledge. This thesis aims to exploit the opportunities of evolving AR technologies to find improved ways of setting up such models. The head-mounted AR device Microsoft HoloLens is used. The HoloLens scans the environment and builds a spatial mesh for its own localization and hologram display that provides the required sensor data. However, the HoloLens serves not only as a sensor platform but also as a modern user interface. Gesture and speech control foster intuitive usage. The developed approach does not require the user to have any expert knowledge in robotics or programming. A Unity based program is run on the HoloLens communicating with ROS (Robot Operating System) running on a Linux workstation to control a Kuka KR5 arc robot. Combining sensor data and an appropriate referencing algorithm, an OctoMap representation is generated in the MoveIt scene in ROS. Furthermore, the user can define additional safety zones. The created model can be displayed and manipulated via the HoloLens. Tests have been performed to check the general functionality and the performance of the developed application. Weaknesses of the model were reduced by the development and application of an appropriate filter. A broader use of AR and an improvement of the hardware promise possibilities to further improve the process and to make it accessible to more users.
