# summary: Implemented synchronization methods for immersive collaborative VR applications
abstract: Social collaboration is an important component in our daily working life. The work in institutes, companies and education increasingly involves stakeholders and interdisciplinary experts from all around the world. For this collaboration applications are required to connect remote team members and support the interaction with their working environment. In the Computer Supported Collaborative Work and Mixed Reality fields highly interactive remote collaboration is researched. Although the number of publications regarding this topic increases, the research does not focus on systems to enable collaborative application creation. On the contrary commercial software supports the creation of remote collaboration applications but does not implement state of the art collaboration methods recommended by research. In this work a concept for an immersive collaboration system to facilitate the creation of collaborative applications was created. Based on the concept a prototype has been implemented with a focus on the synchronization of the collaborative environment between all remote systems. For the evaluation a collaborative application was created with the prototype system to validate the requirements. Additionally, the performance of the synchronization was tested to evaluate the synchronization delay caused by the application. Finally the resulting findings of this work as well as the possibilities for future work are summarized.
