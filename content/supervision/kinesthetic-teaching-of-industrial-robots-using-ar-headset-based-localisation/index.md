abstract: Controlling and programming industrial robots using classic approaches such as teach pendants can be a difficult and tedious task. Unintuitive and unnatural controls require the operator to be a trained professional and even then cause an unpleasant workflow. In an effort to improve upon this and make it more approachable for non-professionals, alternative approaches such as kinesthetic learning have been explored. They promise an easier and more natural handling of robots while maintaining the quality and accuracy that classic approaches provide. And while modern technology has made this achievable, practically realizing it often requires additional hardware resources such as sensors that are built into the robot or a "zero-force mode" that allows the user to easily move it. Models that are built to support kinesthetic learning already provide these features, however, most industrial manipulators that are currently in use do not. As such, they are usually not suited for kinesthetic learning. In this thesis, a new method to control and program industrial robots using Augmented Reality is explored. The goal is to eliminate the need for these special features by using the external sensors and hand tracking capabilities that modern Augmented Reality headsets provide. The thesis discusses the theory and implementation of a system which achieves this to allow kinesthetic learning to be used with industrial robots. It explains which components the system is made up of, how they communicate and which functionalities they fulfill, most importantly the translation of the user’s hand movements into robot controller commands. The AR device that is used for this thesis is the Microsoft HoloLens and, while being designed to work independently of a specific robot’s properties, the system is evaluated using the 6 DoF KUKA KR5 arc model.
