abstract: Human safety is the most important problem in close-proximity human-robot interaction. In this paper, we explore a novel approach based on an augmented reality (AR) device and inertial measurment units (IMUs)for human body tracking in robot cell. The AR device, Microsoft HoloLens 1, provides accurate SLAM-based localization of the device itself as well as hand tracking when the hands are in the field-of-view of the device. The IMUs are used to track the hands while they are not in field-of-view of the device. Experiments are carried out in Kuka KR5 work cell and the results indicate that with regular occasional hand tracking input from the AR device the IMUs' drift can be reduced. The implemented prototype supports the concept of tracking human body based on the AR device and IMUs, which provides new insight into safe human-robot interaction.
