# summary: Developed AR interaction and information display systems for automated warehouses
abstract: With availability of mixed reality headsets to customers, automated warehouse facilities gain a chance to implement augmented reality as a way to aid in worker’s operation and eliminate barriers between humans and robots, allowing shorter bottlenecks in production. This bachelor thesis takes a look at possibilities of navigation construction, robot tracking and interactive information display through the headset to a user. Following an introduction to a problem in the automated storage facilities, the solution is decomposed into explanation of hardware and software used in the technical implementation and clarification on the development of interaction that was carried on in this work. The connection between human and parts of the warehouse, which include AGV’s, products and racks, is built using navigation, information and prevention techniques; in order to consider removing barriers between human and robot operators, and allow continuous coflow of work - one has to provide the user with methods to keep him safe and support him with information, including occlusion, minimap implementation and image recognition. For every solution deducted in this work evaluation is carried out, that is supported with detailed description of technical implementation, visual representation of results, achieved with holograms on HoloLens and scripted in Unity. To conclude, results are summarized, presenting their influence on the practical use in the real representations of automated warehouses. Additionally, an outlook is formed, to predict possible future development and address necessary adjustments in cases of further improvement.
