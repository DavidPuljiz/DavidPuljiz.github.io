# summary: Created low-cost AR glasses for text visualization applications
abstract: Reading of long-form content is decreasing significantly as it is no more adapted to the needs of current generations. Consuming content is now thanks to digitization interactive, connected, easily accessible and convenient. The study aims to make book reading more adapted to the current needs by using Augmented Reality (AR). Thereby, a new reader based on AR technology was built iteratively by following a 5-steps design cycle. During the design process the prototypes were tested by potential users to get feedback which was triggering the next design phase. After three iterations, the reader was in form of AR glasses which display text sections as virtual images in the field of view of the user. The reader enhances convenience of reading by providing a hands-free reading experience. The testing sessions showed that the glasses were most interesting to people with physical disabilities.
