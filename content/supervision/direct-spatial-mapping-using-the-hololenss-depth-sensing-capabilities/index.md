# summary: Leveraged HoloLens depth sensing capabilities for spatial mapping
abstract: The HoloLens uses its integrated sensors to create a spatial mesh which is used for the HoloLens’s integrated localization and for the placement and rendering of holograms, but it may also be used by applications to get an understanding of their current environment. Previous works developed at the IAR-IPR use the spatial mesh to obtain a transformation between the HoloLens’s world coordinate system and the world coordinate system of a robotic arm and to generate a safety zone model of the robot’s environment. However, experiments have shown that the HoloLens’s spatial mesh is not accurate enough for the task of creating an accurate safety zone model. This thesis aims at generating a more accurate model of the HoloLens’s environment by directly capturing and processing the raw sensor data of the HoloLens’s depth sensors. The sensor data is streamed to a companion workstation running ROS, where a point cloud is generated for each streamed sensor frame. Using PCL, the newly created point cloud is filtered and aligned to the previous point clouds. In a final postprocessing step, the created point cloud is enhanced by estimating the surface curvature using MLS and by using RANSAC to detect planes. Tests were conducted to discover the individual sources of error and to determine the accuracy of the generated point cloud. The generated point cloud was compared against a laser scan and the HoloLens’s spatial mesh. The results of these tests show that the point cloud generated by the proposed method has a 15 to 16 times higher point density than the HoloLens’s spatial map while also being a bit more accurate than the HoloLens’s spatial mesh.
