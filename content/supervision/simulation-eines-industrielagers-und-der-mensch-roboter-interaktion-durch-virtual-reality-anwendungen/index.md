# summary: Created VR simulation of industrial warehouses and human-robot interaction
abstract: Testing novel technologies inside an autonomous warehouse system is unfeasible, as the end user would have to stop their entire operation to conduct the tests. In the project SafeLog, the aim is to bring a human operator safely into such an automated environment. To test how the human and the safety infrastructure surrounding them influences the system, a virtual reality (VR) environment has been built. This environment automatically creates a warehouse based on the warehouse description file. The environment is connected to a realistic fleet management system that controls the fleet of mobile robots. Using this environment we can safely test novel augmented reality interactions, as well as human-centered planning and intention estimation.
