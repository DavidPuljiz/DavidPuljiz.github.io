# summary: Developed VR interface for cooperative teleoperation and intuitive programming
#   of mobile robot systems
abstract: This M.Sc. Thesis was conducted in cooperation with Andreas Blank from the University of Erlangen. The goal was to achieve efficient transfer of depth data from remote locations to facilitate teleoperation of a robotic arm. As a demonstrator an operator wearing a VR  headset in Karlsruhe was able to successfully operate a robot arm in Erlangen, with minimal to to lag both in the transfer of depth data or in commands to the robot.
