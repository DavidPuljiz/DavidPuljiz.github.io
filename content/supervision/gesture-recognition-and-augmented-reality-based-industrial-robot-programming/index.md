# summary: Developed gesture recognition system for AR-based industrial robot programming
abstract: One of the biggest problems to more widespread use of robotic manipulators, specifically in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), is that robot programing is still long, complicated and usually requires experts. Several different approaches have been tried including making the programing easier with intuitive programing blocks supported by a semantic logic engine, imitation learning or even letting the robots learn the task by themselves through reinforcement learning. Though some of these approaches, particularly the later, will be a must for more autonomous system, in the short term none of them offer any significant improvement over current methods. Augmented reality (AR) offers a more intuitive programing solution â€“ one can program the robot by putting waypoints in the real world, visualise what the robot intends to do, and check for possible collisions. To achieve this, this work will act as a proof of concept in programing industrial robots. For this work on the IPR side, Unity3D and ROS (Robot Operating System) frameworks will be used as well as the Microsoft Hololens for the AR Device. The robot working cell will consist of a KUKA KR-5 robot, a table and a conveyor belt. On the IMI side of things, solutions will be migrated to the PolyVR framework and tested in the CAVE system.
