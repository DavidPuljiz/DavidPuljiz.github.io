# summary: Researched methods for high-precision referencing between robots and augmented
#   reality devices
abstract: To use the full potential of augmented reality it is necessary to have a high-precision referencing between real and virtual objects. To achieve a referencing rgb and depth data is available on current augmented reality devices. Usually markers or manual referencing is currently used for referencing. But automatic referencing is favourable. In this thesis a semiautomatic method to achieve a precise referencing on depth data is introduced by using known registration algorithm. A system with only an initial guess of the user is implemented to reference a Kuka kr5 with a Microsoft Hololens. The implemented solution with the local registration algorithm ICP lead to a precise referencing between the robot and the augmented reality device. The global registration algorithms Super4PC could not reference the robot reliable due to problems with the cluttered robot environment.
