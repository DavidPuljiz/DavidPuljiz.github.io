abstract: Much research has been done on live human-robot cooperation. This thesis presents a proof of concept implementation for a complete system in which a human is supported by a robot with an assembly task. To achieve this we use Microsoft’s Hololens to estimate the humans intention and display holograms. The robot acts to support estimated actions and comunicates it’s own plans to the human. We analyze the performance of parts of the project, identify some bottlenecks and discuss possible solutions.
