abstract: This M.Sc. Thesis was conducted in collaboration with Gunther Schiefer and Martin Bandmann from KUKA. The goal was to evaluate the usefulness of Augmented Reality in future robot set-up and programming paradigms. Interfaces between the KUKA software and the Microsoft HoloLens were developed. The display of safety zones via Augmented Reality during robot set-up was identified as a promising application area.
