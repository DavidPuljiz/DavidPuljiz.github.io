abstract: Germany, like many other developed countries, is currently facing a severe shortage of skilled workers, especially in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) professions. One reason is the demographic shift caused by an aging workforce. According to the federal government, the working-age population will decline by 3.9 million by 2030. In addition, only one-third of all employees in this sector are women, which places Germany at the bottom of the field compared to other European countries. Increasing the participation of women in the labor market can therefore make a positive contribution to securing a skilled workforce. This is also reflected in the field of robotics, making countermeasures to secure skilled workers essential. In this field in particular, the accessibility of learning resources is another barrier to ensuring the training and education of skilled workers. The availability of hardware in higher education institutions severely limits the number of possible learners. Another major problem arose from the Covid-19 pandemic. While the transition to e-learning in various lectures could be accomplished without major problems, the teaching of robotics programming was faced with a major hurdle due to the unavailability of hardware.
