abstract: Heating is one of the major contributors to CO2 emissions. The most promising environmentally friendly heating system will probably be heat pumps. In Germany, for example, in the next 9 years, a five to tenfold increase in current installation speed of heat pumps should be achieved. In view of the shortage of craftsmen in the heating installation industry in Germany, there is an urgent need for tools and solutions that support them in the installation of heat pumps and increases their productivity. Planning the installation of heat pumps in boiler rooms presents a big challenge, as the installation space needs to be accurately checked and possible collisions with already installed equipment, such as water heaters and pipes, need to be accounted for. Overlooked collisions can present significant delays in installation times. This paper presents an Augmented Reality (AR) application to ease the installation process. A mobile device with a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor is used to map the boiler room including all the existing equipment present. This 3D map is used alongside a freely movable 3D model, selected from a library of heat pumps, to check for possible collisions and plan the installation. Measuring tools can also be invoked in the AR application for additional support. After the check is complete, the craftsman may order the appropriate heat pump and conduct the installation itself. To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first system of its kind to be proposed.
