abstract: Adhering to current HRI paradigms, all of the sensors, visualisation and legibility of actions and motions are borne by the robot or its working cell. This necessarily makes robots more complex or confines them into specialised, structured environments. We propose leveraging the state of the art of wearable technologies, such as augmented reality head mounted displays, smart watches, sensor tags and radio-frequency ranging, to "adapt" the human and reduce the requirements and complexity of robots.
